# BinarySearchTree
Example for Binary Search Tree using python and C with pointers.
<h1 style="text-align:center; font-weight:bold;">Linked List, Dynamic Memory Allocation and Binary Trees</h1>

<p style="text-align:center">Summary. This meta-article reviews the contents applied by the Data Structure II subject, applied to the 8th period of Software Engineering, showing the terms of Linked Lists, such as Simply Linked and Doubly Linked, a brief review of pointers in C, and finally, we will review Binary Trees, in this case we chose the Python language, but we will put the example in C as well so that we can have a view of the Binary Tree applying dynamic memory allocation (pointers).</p>

<h2>General information</h2>
<p>As mentioned in the summary of this article, we will cover the topics of Data Structure, explaining a little about the principles of Simply Linked Lists, Doubly Linked Lists, Dynamic Memory Allocation (Pointer) in the case of C and finally we will explain a little about Binary Trees, we will apply the code in python, but the theory applies to different languages, we will show the Binary Search Tree in the code, and we will go through them in pre-order, in-order and post-order modes, we will also leave the code provided by the teacher Fabio Bettio, to make it easier to compare the codes we developed in Python and C.</p>
